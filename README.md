Fine-Grained Aircraft Model Classification Using Transfer Learning and Hyper-Parameter Optimisation.

- The objective was to train a fine-grained image classification model to accurately classify different airplane models using a publicly available dataset.
- Utilised the DenseNet201 architecture with pre-trained ImageNet weights, applying transfer learning for effective feature extraction and classification.
- Achieved approximately 70% accuracy on the test set by fine-tuning the model and optimising hyper-parameters.
- Handled the dataset with distinct training, validation, and test sets to ensure robust model training and unbiased evaluation.
- Assessed model performance using Accuracy (70%), Precision (71.50%), Recall (70.058%), and an F1 Score (69.829%) to evaluate classification results.
